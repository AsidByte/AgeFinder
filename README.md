# AgeFinder

AgeFinder is a simple Python program that calculates your age in any given year â€” past, present, or future.

## How it Works
1. The program asks for your name.

3. You enter the year in which you want to know your age.
4. The program tells you how old you were, are, or will be in that year.

## Example

Enter your birth year: 1995
Enter the year in which you want to know your age: 2030
Alex you will become 35 Years old
